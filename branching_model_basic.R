#------------------------------------------------
# Define the function. Its inputs are as follows:
#------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. R_undetected, the basic reproduction number when a case is undetected
#
# 2. intervention_efficacy, the prop reduction of R when cases detected
#
# 3. serial_interval, a distcrete object representing the serial interval
#    Use the 'make_disc_gamma' function to create this object
#
# 4. r_daily_intro, the daily rate of intro from reservoir
#
# 5. max_duration, the maximum duration of the outbreak
#
# 6. break_point, the time when interventions are introduced

# Note that targeted vaccination is very similar to mass vacc - the difference
# being that we only apply vaccination to cases who are introductions

  # Here we generate new cases from a branching process using the state of 'out'
  # above. The algorithm is:
  
  # 1. Determine the force of infection, i.e. the average number of new cases
  # generated.
  #
  # 2. Draw the number of new cases.
  #
  # 3. Draw features of the new cases.
  #
  # 4. Append new cases to the linelist of cases.
  #
  #
  # The main issue lies in determining the force of infection. For a single
  # individual 'i', it is determined as:
  #
  # lambda_i = R_i * w(t - onset_i)
  #
  # where 'w' is the PMF of the serial interval, 't' the current time, and
  # 'onset_i' the date of onset of case 'i'.
  #
  # The global force of infection at a given point in time is obtained by summing
  # all individual forces of infection.
